# Industrial-Workspace-Safety-Enforcer-AI-Powered-Robotic-Compliance-System
I- based Industrial Workspace Safety Enforcer combining YOLOv8-based deep learning to implement PPE check real-time.The technology applies computer vision to verify whether the workers are donning the proper helmets, vests, gloves, masks, and boots before they enter the work environment.
Ensuring workplace safety in industrial environments is crucial, as employees are often exposed
to hazardous conditions. Traditional manual inspections for Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE) compliance are prone to human error and inefficiency, limiting their effectiveness in large-
scale operations. This study presents an AI-powered Industrial Workspace Safety Enforcer that
leverages real-time computer vision for PPE compliance monitoring. By integrating deep learn-
ing techniques, particularly the YOLOv8 model, the system accurately detects whether workers
are equipped with essential safety gear, including helmets, vests, gloves, masks, and boots.
The proposed system utilizes OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLO, and Python for high-accuracy,
low-latency detection. It is trained on a diverse dataset comprising publicly available PPE im-
ages and manually collected samples. The enforcement mechanism is automated by trigger-
ing alerts and restricting access for non-compliant workers, significantly enhancing workplace
safety standards. Experimental results demonstrate high mean Average Precision (mAP) and
F1-score, validating the system’s efficiency in real-time PPE detection. Future enhancements,
including voice alerts, IoT integration, edge computing optimization, and cloud-based analytics,
are expected to further refine the system’s capabilities, ensuring widespread adoption in indus-
trial safety management
